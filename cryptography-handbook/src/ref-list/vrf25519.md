# VRF-ed25519

Verifiable Random Functions ($ \vrf $) allow key-pair owners, $ (\vrfsk, \vrfvk) $,
to evaluate a pseudorandom function in a provable way given a randomness seed.
Any party with access to the verification key, $\vrfvk$, the
randomness seed, the proof and the generated randomness can indeed verify
that the value is computed as expected. The VRF specification has changed
overtime in Cardano, and the nodes use a different algorith, pre-Babbage and
post-Babbage (if there exists a reference to the HF, we should point it out).
We expose both specifications, and the motivations for such a change.

## Implementation and bindings
We currently rely in the implementation available in the [fork of
libsodium](https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium/tree/iquerejeta/vrf_batchverify). We have analysed, and recommend, bindings in the following languages:
* Haskell: Available in [cardano-base](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/blob/master/cardano-crypto-class/src/Cardano/Crypto/VRF/Class.hs)

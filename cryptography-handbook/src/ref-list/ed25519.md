# Ed25519

Ed25519 is the signature scheme being used in Cardano, and supported in
Plutus. Ed25519 is an instantiation of the EdDSA over the Edwards25519 elliptic curve.

## Implementation and bindings
We currently relly in the implementation available in version [1.0.18 of libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/tree/1.0.18/src/libsodium/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10). We have analysed, and recommend, bindings
in the following languages:
* Haskell: Available in [cardano-base](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/blob/master/cardano-crypto-class/src/Cardano/Crypto/DSIGN/Ed25519.hs)
* Rust: Made [available](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium-sys-stable) by the original author of libsodium
* Javascript: Made [available](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js) by the original author of libsodium (among others)

There also exist other implementations that offer a compatible signing algorithm which do not require the full
usage of libsodium. The list we have analaysed and recommend is the following: 
* Rust: [ed25519-dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek), **using the `verify_strict()`** function.
* Javascript: [tweetnacl-js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js), though the verification criteria of this library **is more permissive**,
  meaning that a valid signature for tweetnacl-js might not be valid for Cardano.

## Common mistakes
An ed25519 signature consists of two values $ (R,s) $, where $ R $ is an elliptic curve point
and $ s\in\mathbb{Z}_{\order} $ is a scalar. A common mistake when deserialising the scalar $ s $
is to compute it modulo $ \order $ in case that $ s $ is larger than $ \order $. This must be 
avoided, specifically in consensus critical scenarios. 

Another common mistake is what criteria to use when deserialising an elliptic curve point. If none
of the libraries listed above are used, the engineer should carefully read the [sections](#generalised-specification)
[below](#parameters-of-instantiation) to understand the details, and the verification criteria used
in Cardano.

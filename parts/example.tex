\section*{Example Section}
\subsection*{Summary}
\textit{This section covers a summary of the properties of the cryptographic primitives. What it can do, and how
different it is from similar primitives. For instance, explicitly distinguishing threshold signatures from
multi-signatures, from ATMs, etc.}
\subsection*{Generalised specification}
\textit{This section covers the specific instantiation as presented from the reference (either academic paper or
standard).}

\subsection*{Parameters of instantiation}
\textit{This section covers the details of the primitive. It should cover all that is required for an external
observer to implement a compatible version without needing to look into the code. This should cover, the curve
parameters, hashing algorithms, format, serialisation/deserialisation mechanisms, etc.}

\subsection*{External links}
\textit{Links of interest, such as papers, gdocs, jira pages, etc.}

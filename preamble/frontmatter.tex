\begin{abstract}
This document contains the list of the different cryptographic primitives of interest for IOHK. The 
goal of this document is to have, in a single place, the list of the primitives that are being used, 
or intended of being used soon.

\section*{Including new primitives}
If a project needs a particular primitive, which is not present in this document, the mechanism 
to include is simple. Add an issue to the repo, 
\url{https://github.com/input-output-hk/cryptography_spec}, specifying why such a 
primitive is of interest, and how it would be used. To make the discussion more effective, 
it is also of interest to link references to the specification, or available implementations.

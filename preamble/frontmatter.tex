\begin{abstract}
  This document contains the list of the different cryptographic primitives of interest for IOHK. We
  present in detail the instantitations that are being used/implemented, as well as the parameters
  used in our production systems.
  A first iteration of this document

\section*{Including new primitives}
If a project needs a particular primitive, which is not present in this document, the mechanism 
to include is simple. Add an issue to the repo, 
\url{https://github.com/input-output-hk/cryptography_spec}, specifying why such a 
primitive is of interest, and how it would be used. To make the discussion more effective, 
it is also of interest to link references to the specification, or available implementations.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This document contains the list of the different cryptographic primitives of interest for IOHK. We
  present in detail the instantitations that are being used/implemented, as well as the parameters
  used in our production systems.
  This document contains a specification of all the cryptographic primitives being used in production,
  or in testing phase, and at least a reference to the ongoing efforts of other cryptographic primitives.

\section*{Including new primitives}
If a project needs a particular primitive, which is not present in this document, the mechanism 
to include is simple. Add a CIP motivating such a request. Details on how to do that can be found
in \href{https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0001}{CIP-0001}. If the request
is internal and it is desired to keep the request private, add an issue to the repo,
\url{https://github.com/input-output-hk/cryptography_spec}, specifying why such a 
primitive is of interest, and how it would be used. To make the discussion more effective, 
it is also of interest to link references to the specification, or available implementations.
